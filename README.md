# CardGameServer

A simple card game server. The only implemented game so far is Ping. 
I'm unsure if anyone has really heard of it. The closest rules I can 
find are: 

    http://www.pagat.com/rummy/3-13.html

My family rules deviate a little bit.

### Server

The server uses a REST implementation.
